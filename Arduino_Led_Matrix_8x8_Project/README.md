             What is the game about? 
                  -Meteors are moving towards our Spaceship, in order to survive we can shoot them using our limited number of Rockets.
                  -If a rocket hits a meteor, your number of points increases
                  -If a meteors touches the Spaceship, the crew dies and you lose the game.
                  -Because it's hard to play this game, we thought it's fair to give you 3 lives. That means you have 3 chances to save the people that live on the Spaceship.
                  -Good luck! You will need it :) .
                      
             How to play the game?
                  -to start the game, you have to hold and press Right and Left button at the same time
                  -to start new match, you have to hold and press Right and Left button at the same time
                  -to move the Spaceship to the right you have to press the Right button 
                   (the one on the right side, that has an 'R' on it)
                  -to move the Spaceship to the left you have to press the Left button 
                   (the one on the left side, that has an 'L' on it)
                   -to shoot Meteors you have to press rightFireButton (the small one, on the right side) or leftFireButton (the small one, on the left side)
                     ATTENTION! You can shoot just one Rocket by pressing either the rightFireButton or the leftFireButton.
                                You can't press them both in the same time.
             
             How does the game work?
                  -you will hear a sound that will let you know a new match starts
                  -when the game starts, on the display it will appear the text 'Start new game'
                  -to start a new game you have to hold and press Right and Left button at the same time
                  -once you pressed on them, the screen will blink a few times, and you'd better be ready to destroy same meteors!!
                  -you will see that at the buttom of the display there is a line with 2 'arms', that is our Spaceship!
                  -you can move the Spaceship to the left or to the right
                  -the meteors are at the top of the display. You better shoot them quickly 'cause they are coming at you!
                  -once a meteor touches the ground, the hole column of meteors disappears
                  -once a meteor hits the Spaceship, you lose a life
                  -if all your lives are gone, you lost the game :(
                   a lower tune will be sent; 
                   the text 'Game over Score <number of ponits>' will appear on display;
